                The Witness Project/We See You is part of the Freedom Interrupted collaboration on race, gender, nation and policing. This portion of the collaboration foregrounds the humanizing texts, images and perspectives of artists who invite us to witness the unfolding of events relative to policing in our nation and to see how communities respond. Such images and pieces of art are an invitation to stop, see, and think more deeply about this moment, our relationship to it and what it says about who we are at the same time that they ask us to think about who we most want to be.

                <p>The Latina/o Studies Program presents a selection of downloadable posters designed, made, and disseminated by Dignidad Rebelde, a graphic arts collaboration between Oakland-based artists Jesus Barraza and Melanie Cervantes.  <img src="http://as.cornell.edu/sites/as/files/rebelde-and-barraza.jpg" alt="" align="left"/>Dignidad Rebelde partners with grassroots organizations and allied institutions to empower communities in their fight for quality of life and political enfranchisement, to enact their dreams and shared visions. "Following principles of Xicanisma and Zapatismo," Dignidad Rebelde writes, "we create work that translates people's stories into art that can be put back into the hands of the communities who inspire it."</p>

                <p>
                Another important aspect of Dignidad Rebelde's posters concerns their form, which is of the highest quality. As they write: "our art is for museums, collectors' exhibitions, community and cultural centers, individual homes, political rallies and more.  We are committed to advancing the acceptance of people's art as quality art, and to nurturing a model of art-making grounded in collaboration with community organizations and other networks of artists."

                <p>We See You: Too often cis and trans black female victims of police violence go unseen and unsung, giving rise to a false narrative that over-policing is a problem for cis black men only. Individual World Poetry Slam Champion Porsha O calls out that false narrative and urges us to #SayHerName. The African American Policy Forum launched the #SayHerName campaign to bring black women and girls' experience with police brutality to the fore. </p>
